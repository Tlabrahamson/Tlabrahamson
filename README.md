# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My Name is Tim Abrahamson

I enjoy building websites. :computer:

### A Little About Myself

I was exposed to coding in high school. I took a couple of Java programming courses and while I didn't really grasp it fully, I enjoyed it. I was under the impression that you *had* to have a college degree to pursue a career in tech so my interest fizzled out. :frowning: I didn't have the funds and wanted to avoid the debt of a college education. :disappointed:

Fast forward through a nine year stretch in the fast food industry, my fiance encouraged me to pursue my dream! I started to learn web development through freecodecamp.org and my love was revived. I enrolled in a 19 week program on full stack web development at a local community college and began to learn even more. After receiving the certification, I landed a 3 month internship with Kinetic Communications in Birmingham, AL.

Once the three month period expired, I was able to get a handful of freelance gigs and now I am here! 

I am *actively* seeking a full time developer position. 

**I'm Ready!** :raised_hands:

I am always learning. :books:

I am always building new projects. :construction:

I don't push every project to git. :octocat:

What is this thing? --> :shipit:
